## üêõ Active Bugs

### 1. Intent Pattern Conflict - Transport with Arrival Time
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** Medium
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-15

**Issue:**
When saying "Arrivare a Vercelli con i mezzi pubblici alle 12", the intent parser incorrectly matches `transport_car` instead of `transport_public`.

**Details:**
```
Input: "Arrivare a Vercelli con i mezzi pubblici alle 12"
Expected: transport_public with destination="vercelli", arrival_time="12"
Actual: transport_car with destination="vercelli con i mezzi pubblici", arrival_time="12"
```

**Root Cause:**
The car transport pattern `arrivare a (.+?) (?:alle|per le) (\d{1,2}(?::\d{2})?)` is too greedy and matches before the public transport patterns can be evaluated. The `.+?` captures "vercelli con i mezzi pubblici" as the destination.

**Proposed Fix:**
- Reorder patterns so public transport patterns are checked before car patterns
- OR make car pattern more specific to exclude "con i mezzi" phrases
- OR add negative lookahead: `arrivare a (.+?)(?! con i mezzi) (?:alle|per le)`

**Workaround:**
Use alternative phrasings:
- "Mezzi pubblici per Vercelli per arrivare alle 12" ‚úÖ
- "Quando devo partire per Vercelli per arrivare alle 12" ‚úÖ

**Files Affected:**
- `/Volumes/jarvis/functions/intents.py` (lines 460-494)

### 2. Concatenated Queries - Only Executes First Intent
**Status:** Open (By Design for Phase 1)
**Priority:** Medium
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-15

**Issue:**
Concatenated queries are detected and split correctly, but only the FIRST sub-query is executed.

**Details:**
```
Input: "Che tempo fa e che ore sono?"
Expected: Weather AND time responses
Actual: Only weather response

Detection Works:
‚úÖ Detects concatenation
‚úÖ Splits into ["Che tempo fa", "che ore sono?"]
‚úÖ Correctly identifies weather as primary intent
‚ùå Does NOT execute time (second query ignored)
```

**Root Cause:**
`alfred.py` lines 375-383 - designed to execute only first intent for Phase 1 simplicity.

**Proposed Fix:**
Execute ALL sub-queries and combine results:
```python
if len(sub_queries) > 1:
    responses = []
    for sq in sub_queries:
        sub_result = parse_intent(sq)
        sub_response = execute_intent(sub_result)
        responses.append(sub_response)

    # Combine
    combined = ". E poi, ".join(responses) if lang=='it' else ". And then, ".join(responses)
    speak(combined)
```

**Files Affected:**
- `/Volumes/jarvis/alfred.py` (lines 375-383)

### 3. Ollama Timeouts
**Status:** Open (Intermittent)
**Priority:** Medium
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-15

**Issue:**
Ollama API sometimes times out after 45 seconds, causing fallback responses.

**Details:**
```
Test 1: "What should I wear?" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Worked (225 chars in ~3s)
Test 2: "Dimmi le news e il meteo" ‚Üí ‚ùå Timed out after 45s
Test 3: "Che tempo fa?" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Worked (192 chars in ~2s)

Pattern: Random timeouts, possibly due to model not preloaded
```

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Preload model at startup (already exists in code!)
2. Increase timeout to 90s
3. Add retry logic

**Files Affected:**
- `/Volumes/jarvis/functions/response_generator.py` (line 66)

---

### 4. Concatenation Keywords Too Strict
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** Low
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-15

**Issue:**
Some concatenation patterns not detected because patterns require spaces on both sides.

**Details:**
```
Input: "Dimmi le news e il meteo"
Issue: "le" ends with 'e', so " e " pattern doesn't match
Pattern: r'\s+e\s+' requires spaces on BOTH sides

Input: "Meteo & News"
Issue: "&" not in keyword list
```

**Proposed Fix:**
Make patterns more flexible:
```python
r'\be\b',        # Word boundary (catches "news e meteo")
r'\s*&\s*',      # Allow "&" with optional spaces
```

**Files Affected:**
- `/Volumes/jarvis/functions/simple_concatenation_parser.py` (lines 21-32)

### 5. Language Mixing in AI Responses
**Status:** Open (Feature, not bug!)
**Priority:** Low
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-15

**Issue:**
Alfred sometimes mixes English and Italian in responses.

**Details:**
```
Input (Italian): "Che tempo fa?"
Response: "Very well, sir. Il tempo √® di circa 18 gradi..."
          ^^^^^^^^^^ English    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Italian

This is the "British butler speaking Italian" personality quirk!
```

**Decision:**
Keep as-is - it's charming! British butler should say "sir" even in Italian.

**Alternative Fix (if needed):**
Post-process Italian responses to replace "sir" ‚Üí "signore"

## üìã Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 Polish
- ‚úÖ Execute all sub-queries in concatenated queries (Medium priority)
- ‚úÖ Preload Ollama model at startup (Easy win)
- ‚úÖ Add more flexible concatenation patterns (Nice to have)

### Language Detection
- Improve Italian keyword detection for mixed phrases
- Handle code-switching between Italian and English

### Time Parsing
- Support natural time expressions ("mezzogiorno" for "12", "sera" for evening)
- Handle relative times ("fra un'ora", "in 30 minuti")

### Transport
- Add walking/cycling modes
- Support multiple destinations
- Calculate cost estimates for transit

### General
- Cache frequent Ollama responses
- Batch multiple API calls
- Voice recognition for multiple users
- Mobile app for remote control

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### Variable Name Collision - `duration`
**Fixed:** 2025-10-15
**Issue:** Global `duration` variable (1.5s for recording) was overwritten by transit duration string ("22 mins")
**Solution:** Renamed to `travel_duration` in transport handlers

### Transport Functions - None Origin
**Fixed:** 2025-10-15
**Issue:** `get_traffic_status(None, destination)` failed because None is not valid
**Solution:** Added DEFAULT_LOCATION fallback when origin is None

### Recipe Search - Punctuation in Parameters
**Fixed:** 2025-10-15
**Issue:** "Recipe for pasta." captured "pasta." with period
**Solution:** Added `.rstrip('.,!?;:')` to parameter extraction

## üìù Notes

- When adding new intent patterns, always consider pattern order (specific before generic)
- Test with both languages (English and Italian)
- Check for variable name collisions with global scope variables
