## 🎓 What We've Learned

### Successes
- ✅ Pattern-based intent parsing is fast and accurate
- ✅ Template responses work well for structured queries
- ✅ Bilingual support with language detection is effective
- ✅ Free APIs (TheMealDB, CoinGecko) are reliable
- ✅ Google Maps API is powerful for transport

### Challenges
- ⚠️ Pattern order matters - specific before generic
- ⚠️ Variable name collisions can cause subtle bugs
- ⚠️ Google Maps driving mode doesn't support arrival_time
- ⚠️ Punctuation in voice commands needs stripping
- ⚠️ Some patterns are too greedy and capture too much

### Best Practices Established
- ✅ Use .rstrip() for all captured parameters
- ✅ Document pattern order importance
- ✅ Track known issues in PROBLEMS.md
- ✅ Manual time calculation for driving arrival times
- ✅ Fallback to DEFAULT_LOCATION when origin is None
